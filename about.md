# Just another Linux blog

> “A company of believers **is like** a prison full of criminals; their intimacy and solidarity is based on what they can least justify about themselves.”  - John Updike

If monopolied tech giants of the like currently so prevalent today could be described as **companies of believers** then I'd advise avoiding the products they so sedulously dispense. The open-source community has a ready fix for most of the woes plaguing our internet based communications and operating systems, all we have to do is educate ourselves about the available choices.

Perhaps, saying **No** to the **illegal** theft of personal data by choosing software that respects personal rights might have positive effects, eventually!

> *my approach*: 
**respect and honour [ethical](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics/) behaviour, give generously to those deserving tribute and resist totalitarianism - always**.

My home study contains two comfortable swivel chairs, a huge solid wood table, two bare-bones PCs, one ISP[^1] fiber modem, one asuswrt[^2] gigabit dual wan wireless router, a wireless black and white laser-jet printer and two rooted android based smartphones. It's a comfortable little space - mostly free from vampire digital tools and purposively leaky operating systems:
